The Mass Univariate ERP Toolbox is a freely available set of MATLAB functions for performing mass univariate analyses of event-related potentials (ERPs), a noninvasive measure of neural activity popular in cognitive neuroscience.  It was produced by Marta Kutas's lab in the Cognitive Science Department of the University of California, San Diego.  Tutorial materials for the toolbox are available here:

If you use the toolbox for a publication, please cite the following article:

The more citations the article gets, the more resources we can allocate to further developing the toolbox.
