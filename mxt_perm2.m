%
% mxt_perm2-Two sample permutation test based on a t-statistic and null
% hypothesis of a mean difference of zero.  For one-tailed tests, the null distribution
% is derived from the most extreme t-score of all permutations.  For two-tailed
% tests, the null distribution is derived from the maximum absolute t-score of
% all permutations.  Can handle multiple electrodes and time
% points. According to Hemmelammnn et al. (2004), the t_max permutation
% test has relatively good power for multivariate data whose dimensions are
% highly correlated (like EEG/ERP data).  See Maris (2004) for an
% explanation of how permutation tests like this control for multiple
% comparisons.  Note, Maris uses Hotelling's multivariate T^2 statistic in
% his paper (instead of the t_max used here) and he advocated performing
% the tests over multiple time points (e.g., a 10 ms time window).
% However, I found that the T^2 statistic did not have much power when the
% sample size was near the number of electrodes and the results of the test
% could vary greatly depending on the size of the time window.
%
% Required Inputs:
%  dataA  - 3D matrix of ERPs from Group A (Channel x Time x Participant)
%  dataB  - 3D matrix of ERPs from Group B (Channel x Time x Participant)
%
% Optional Inputs:
%  n_perm - number of permutations {default=1000}.  Manly (1997) suggests
%           using at least 1000 permutations for an alpha level of 0.05 and 
%           at least 5000 permutations for an alpha level of 0.01.
%  alph   - test alpha level {default=.05}
%  tail   - [1 | 0 | -1] If tail=1, the alternative hypothesis is that the
%           means of Group A are greater than those of Group B (upper tailed test).  
%           If tail=0, the alternative hypothesis is that the means of the 
%           two groups are different (two tailed test).  If tail=-1, the 
%           alternative hypothesis is that the means of Group A are less 
%           than those of Group B (lower tailed test). {default: 0}
%  verblevel   - An integer specifiying the amount of information you want
%                this function to provide about what it is doing during runtime.
%                 Options are:
%                    0 - quiet, only show errors, warnings, and EEGLAB reports
%                    1 - stuff anyone should probably know
%                    2 - stuff you should know the first time you start working
%                        with a data set {default value}
%                    3 - stuff that might help you debug (show all
%                        reports)
%  seed_state  - The initial state of the random number generating stream
%                (see MATLAB documentation for "randstream"). If you pass
%                a value from a previous run of this function, it should
%                reproduce the exact same values.
%  freq_domain - If 0, command line report will be given in temporal units
%                (e.g. time points).  Otherwise, the report will be given 
%                in frequency domain units (e.g., frequencies). {default:
%                0}
%
% Outputs:
%  pval       - p-value at each time point and electrode (corrected for
%                multiple comparisons via permutation test)
%  t_orig     - t-score at each time point and electrode
%  tmx_ptile  - critical t-scores for given alpha level
%  seed_state - The initial state of the random number generating stream
%               (see MATLAB documentation for "randstream") used to 
%               generate the permutations. You can use this to reproduce
%               the output of this function.
%  est_alpha  - The estimated family-wise alpha level of the test.  With 
%               permutation tests, a finite number of p-values are possible.
%               This function tries to use an alpha level that is as close 
%               as possible to the desired alpha level.  However, if the 
%               sample size is small, a very limited number of p-values are 
%               possible and the desired family-wise alpha level may be 
%               impossible to acheive.
%
% Notes:
% -The null hypothesis of this test is that the data in the two groups are
% "exchangeable" (i.e., the data from a participant in Group A was just as
% likely to have come from Group B).  If the distributions of the two
% populations you're comparing differ in *any* way (i.e., not just in
% central tendency), the null hypothesis will be violated.  For example, if
% the ERPs of the two groups differ in their variability, but not their
% average value (e.g., one set of ERPs is from a group of children and the
% other adults), you'll be more likely than alpha to reject the null
% hypothesis.
%
% -Unlike a parametric test (e.g., an ANOVA), a discrete set of p-values
% are possible (at most the number of possible permutations).  Since the
% number of possible permutations grows rapdily with the number of
% participants, this is only an issue for small sample sizes (e.g., 3
% participants in each group).  When you have such a small sample size, the
% limited number of p-values may make the test overly conservative (e.g., 
% you might be forced to use an alpha level of .0286 since it is the biggest
% possible alpha level less than .05).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REVISION LOG %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% 3/26/2010-fixed critical t-scores (tmx_ptiles) for two-tailed test.  I was
% allowing them to be asymmetrical but this differed from how I was
% computing p-values.  It turns out the way I was computing p-values (from
% Hemmelmann) was effectively using the absolute value of all the t-scores.
% Thus the critical t scores should be symmetrical.
%
% 4/1/2010-Estimated alpha level added
%
% 12/14/2010-freq_domain optional input added
%
% 3/17/2013-Randomization is now compatible with Matlab v13. Thanks to
% Aaron Newman for the fix.

%This code has an appropriate false positive rate when run on simulated
%data at one time point:
%
% tested with script: sim_mxt_perm2.m
% n_sim=4000, n_perm=3000, data=2x3, 16 participants per group, Gaussian, alpha=.05
% Two-tailed test: Empirical alpha rate: 0.0495 (SE=.0034)
% Upper tailed test: Empirical alpha rate: 0.0503 (SE=0.0035)
% Lower tailed test: Empirical alpha rate: 0.0500 (SE=.0034)
%
% n_sim=4000, n_perm=3000, data=2x3, 16 participants Group A, 20 Group B, Gaussian, alpha=.05
% Lower tailed test: Empirical alpha rate: 0.0502 (SE=.0035)
% Upper tailed test: Empirical alpha rate: 0.0483 (SE=.0034)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% -Test for equality of trials or variance?
% -Add alternate test statistics?
